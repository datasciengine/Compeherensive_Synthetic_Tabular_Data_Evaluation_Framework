# Compeherensive Synthetic Tabular Data Evaluation Framework
## Introcudtion
This repo was created to develop comprehensive metrics for multi-faceted evaluation of synthetic tabular datasets and to provide them in an open source format. The biggest motivation for this work is the confusion about evaluating synthetic data and the fact that the promised solutions do not fully meet the need. When academic studies, open source studies and paid applications are examined, it is seen that there is no universal standard for evaluating synthetic tabular data.

The two essential materials for the repo to work are real and synthetic data sets.
